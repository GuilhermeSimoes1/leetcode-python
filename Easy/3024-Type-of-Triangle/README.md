Type Of Triangle
-
Hello again, for this exercise, I don’t think I need to explain too much. It’s a “mathematical” exercise with some if statements in the middle.
In the problem statement, we are told that there are three types of triangles: equilateral (all three sides are equal), isosceles (two sides are equal), and scalene (all sides have different lengths).
Another important property of a triangle is that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side, i.e., s1 + s2 > s3, s1 + s3 > s2, and s2 + s3 > s1.

Step 1
-
First i check if all sides are equal, if they are, it is a equilateral triangle:

Step 2
-
In this step I check if the triangle has two equal sides. If it does, I add the sides in pairs and verify whether each sum is greater than the side that is not included, and return "isosceles" or if exists a sum of pairs that is lower than the side who is not included i return "none" because is impossible.

Step 3
-
In this last step i check if all the sides are different, if they are, i add the sides in pairs and verify whether each sum is greater than the side that is not included, and return "scalene" if any pair sum is less than or equal to the remaining side, I return "none" because such a triangle is impossible.

Nothing can win a "if" solution xD.
